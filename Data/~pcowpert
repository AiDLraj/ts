<h2><a id="analytics">Analytics at AUT</h2>

<p> 
In general terms, analytics means methods of logical analysis.
However, in applications, analytics has come to mean the use of computer technology 
and statistics to solve problems in business and industry so that, in this sense, analytics
is strongly linked to information systems and software environments.  
To reflect this analytics at AUT has a strong foundation in mathematics, 
statistics, and statistical programming, 
followed by more vocational subjects in the latter part of the programme. 
A suitable and popular choice is to do a double major in Analytics with either Computer Science or 
Applied Mathematics.  
</p>

<p>
The analytics major at AUT consists primarily of three streams: 
(i) applied statistics; (ii) data mining and statistical programming; (iii) applied probability and
stochastic modelling. 
Papers that form the core to the analytics major include: Applied Statistics,  Probability, Forecasting, 
Logical Database Design, Statistical Methods,  
Data Mining and Knowledge Engineering, Statistical Computing with SAS, Industrial and Business Analytics, 
and Applied Stochastic Models.  
The ideology
underpinning the S language and, especially, R (being an open
source environment with properties of a functional language), also 
forms a thread through the major.  Although proprietary software
is required for courses that have particular industrial and
business applications, typically the selected software environments
are open source and free to foster the sharing of knowledge with the wider
community.
